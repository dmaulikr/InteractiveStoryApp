# Interactive Story Space Adventure Game

I'm building a *Choose your own adventure* text-based game for iOS with Swift 3.
In this game, a user can make one of two choices during each step of the adventure before
advancing to the next part of the story. They can keep selecting choices until
they reach the end of the game.


This is part of a [Treehouse course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-an-interactive-story-app-with-swift-2)
to learn iOS development. Since this course was written with Swift 2, I will be
recreating it in Swift 3 and learning a few things along the way.


## Learning Objectives

* Learn how to build reusable views and view controllers.

* Learn how to use `UINavigationController` to navigate to a new view in a specific
path and how to navigate back to the beginning of the game when it is finished.

* Learn how to accept user input to dynamically create a story.

* Learn how to implement a hierarchical data model and style of navigation in
the context of an iOS app.

* Learn how to create custom view controllers.

* Learn how to create and layout views programatically.

* Learn about Audio APIs in iOS to play sound effects during the game.

* Learn how to implement notifications.

* Learn how to create layout anchors and contraints.
